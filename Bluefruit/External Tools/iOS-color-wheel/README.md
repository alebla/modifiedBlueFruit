A fully scalable, dynamically rendered color wheel for iOS.

Most other open source color picker solutions work by sampling colors out of a pre rendered image. This constrains the color picker to the size and quality of the image provided. This project aims to create a color wheel that mathematically generates the entire color pallet, giving you a 100% scalable view and much more accurate color selection.

Color wheels are based on color selection with HSB (Hue, Saturation and Brightness) color space. Angle is hue, saturation is distance from the center, and brightness is controlled with a separate slider.

Included is single standalone class and example project.
